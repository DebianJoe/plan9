Plan 9 hybrid build scripts.

DO NOT USE UNTIL I SAY IT'S AT LEAST SEMI-SAFE!!!  I've fried 2 installs so far, so this is beyond sketchy.

Ok, so it semi-works (only breaks stuff you don't totally require to boot) on at least one system.  If you are nuts enough to run this after installing
9base or plan9port, then you can't come to me crying that "plan 9's ____ broke my GNomely-widget".  OF COURSE IT DID!!!  'progress' makes copies of most of GNU's
toolchain, and then forces the Plan9 binaries into their place.  Does this sound safe?  No, because it isn't.

Consider that the non-warranty.  This is 90% sure to break your stuff.
